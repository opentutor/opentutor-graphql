Releases
--------

Currently, this image is semantically versioned. When making changes that you want to test in another project, create a branch and PR and then you can release a test tag one of two ways:

To build/push a pre-release semver tag of `opentutor-graphql` for the current commit in your branch

- create a [github release](https://github.com/ICTLearningSciences/opentutor-graphql/releases/new) **from your development branch** with tag format `/^\d+\.\d+\.\d+(-[a-z\d\-.]+)?$/` (e.g. `1.0.0-alpha.1`)
- find the `docker_tag_release` workflow for your git tag in [github actions](https://github.com/ICTLearningSciences/opentutor-graphql/actions?query=workflow%3A%22build%2Fpub+candidate%22)
- this will create a tag like `opentutor/opentutor-graphql:1.0.0-alpha.1`



Once your changes are approved and merged to main, you should create a release tag in semver format as follows:

- create a [github release](https://github.com/ICTLearningSciences/opentutor-graphql/releases/new) **from main** with tag format `/^\d+\.\d+\.\d$/` (e.g. `1.0.0`)
- find the `docker_tag_release` workflow for your git tag in [github actions](https://github.com/ICTLearningSciences/opentutor-graphql/actions?query=workflow%3A%22build%2Fpub+release%22)
- this will create a tag like `opentutor/opentutor-graphql:1.0.0`
